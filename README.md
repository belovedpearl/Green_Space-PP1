## Design Choices

---


* The design choice was dictated by my ability to use the knowledge gained from the first module of the course. While presenting challenges, it allowed me to achieve a further growth in understanding of the concepts taught better.

* From the start of the program, I aimed to design a website that covers in detail concepts taught in the module and more.

### Font

* Roboto
    * Evokes a clean and bold style which prompts its readers wanting to act.
* Archivo
    * I believe it complements and blends with Roboto font to give a meaning outlook to the design.


### Colour Scheme

   
   In line with the motive of the website, I have selected a shade of green **(Hex Value = #184E20)** and **White** to complement the green nature attribute that the site promotes.
   I have checked the contrast of both colors use as foreground and background. Contrast result gave the following;

   |Foreground | Background | Contrast Ratio | Comment |
   |-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
   | #184E20   |  White     | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |
   | White     |  #184E20   | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |

   
   I have also used **RGB(230,32,65)** as an **accent** color to especially in places where the users attention is needed.

--- 

## Accessibility

---

I have designed the site to be easily accessible  with links thats connect different page together in order to prompt decision making and to allow for ease of access to information required bt its users.

* Services section
   
   This introduces the user to garden standard practices and easy access with links connecting its providers.
  
* Contact Us

   This is included to provide easy contact to the providers.

---

## Technology, Frameworks and Programs

---

### Languages
* HTML

* CSS

### Frameworks and Programs


* Balsamiq
    * Used to create wireframes to plan the project


* Github
    * To store written code


* Gitpod
    * The project was put together using Gitpod development environment. From here, I could commit and push all of my changes to Github throughout the project.

---

## Bugs

---

* Caption Image
    * I discovered the caption image was not properly placed on smaller screen, it was resolved by resizing and viewing it till I got a properly placed caption image.
* Input on contact form not displaying text
    * Using the dev tool, I realised "Color: white" set on the input caused the bug. Removing the color fixed the bug.
*  Images appeared smaller than I intend, changing background size contain to cover fixed it.


* "More Service" link on the index page was too close to the content

    * Adding padding, height and centering text to the div fixed this.

* Footer on service page was not properly presented, looking through the html code, I realised a wrong id was inserted.

---

## Deployment

---


* The project was deployed via Github Pages.

The following illustrate the steps I took to deplay my website;

  * Go to the repository for Green Space.
  * Click on the "Settings" tab, locate the "Pages" tab and click it.
  * In the "Build and Deployment" section there is a "Branch Heading". Select to deploy from "main" branch in the dropdown option.
  * Click on save
  * A few minutes later, after refreshing the page, there will automatically be an update containing the "live site link".
