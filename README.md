 ---

## Design Choices

---


* The design choice was dictated by my ability to use the knowledge gained from the first module of the course. While presenting challenges, it allowed me to achieve a further growth in understanding of the concepts taught better.

* From the start of the program, I aimed to design a website that covers in detail the concepts taught in the module and more.

### Font

* Roboto
    * Evokes a clean and bold style which prompts its readers wanting to act.
* Archivo
    * I believe it complements and blends with Roboto font to give a meaning outlook to the design.


### Colour Scheme

   
   In line with the motive of the website, I have selected a shade of green **(Hex Value = #184E20)** and **White** to complement the green nature attribute that the site promotes.
   Using [color contrast checker](https://dequeuniversity.com/) have checked the contrast of both colors use as foreground and background. Contrast result gave the following;

   |Foreground | Background | Contrast Ratio | Comment |
   |-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
   | #184E20   |  White     | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |
   | White     |  #184E20   | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |

   
   I have also used **RGB(230,32,65)** as an **accent** color to especially in places where the users attention is needed.

--- 

## Accessibility

---

I have designed the site to be easily accessible  with links thats connect different pages together in order to prompt decision making and to allow for ease of access to information required by its users.

* Services section
   
   This introduces the user to garden standard practices and easy access with links connecting its providers.
* Blog Section

   This section provides users with gardening updates. I have designed all links to open in a new tab.
   
* Contact Us

   This is included to provide easy contact to the providers.

    * To store written code


* Gitpod
    * The project was put together using Gitpod development environment. From here, I could commit and push all of my changes to Github throughout the project.

---

## Bugs

---

### Fixed Bugs

* Caption Image
    * I discovered the caption image was not properly placed on smaller screen, it was resolved by resizing and viewing it till I got a properly placed caption image.
* Input on contact form not displaying text
    * Using the dev tool, I realised "Color: white" set on the input caused the bug. Removing the color fixed the bug.
*  Images appeared smaller than I intend, changing background size contain to cover fixed it.


* "More Service" link on the index page was too close to the content

    * Adding padding, height and centering text to the div fixed this.

* Footer on service page was not properly presented, looking through the html code, I realised a wrong id was inserted.

* Cursor on submit button was noticed to be in arrow.
   * Changing cursor setting to pointer fixed this.

* Table used in the contact form gave more margin between the cells ob changing the display to block.
   * Changing the table tag to unordered list gave the list equal spacing when changed to block display.
* Textarea was noticed to be smaller than the other inputs on small screen.
   * Adjusting the style on the textarea fixed this.

### Unfixed Bugs

  * I noticed errors in the console which is a result of the embeded google map. It displays appropriately, I feel it is above my current knowledge.

  * Some of my commit statements are not so specific but it was improved upon in subsequent commits.

## Deployment

---

### GitHub Pages

* The project was deployed via Github Pages.

The following illustrate the steps I took to deplay my website;

  * Go to the repository for Green Space.
  * Click on the "Settings" tab, locate the "Pages" tab and click it.
  * In the "Build and Deployment" section there is a "Branch Heading". Select to deploy from "main" branch in the dropdown option.
  * Click on save
  * A few minutes later, after refreshing the page, there will automatically be an update containing the "live site link".

The live link can be found [here](https://belovedpearl.github.io/Green_Space-PP1/).

### How to Fork
  
  By forking a repository, you make a copy of a repository without affecting the original repository. You can fork this repository using the following steps.

  * Login to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/belovedpearl/Green_Space-PP1).

  * At the top of the repository just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.

## Testing

   ### Validator Testing

#### HTML


On all html pages, some issues were found during the check over [W3C Validator check](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

   - I was warned that <link rel="preload"> must have "as" attribute.
      > Included "as" in the link tag solved this issue.

   - Error: loading:"Easy" not to be included in div at this time
      > Removing all "loading" attribute fixed this

   - An error in identifying a class as an attribute.
      > Changed the identified id to class attribute
   
   - Label id was identified to be wrongly spelt.
      > Changed the letter to a lower case.

   - Table header was less than column created.
      > Added more "th" to the "tr"

   - Attribute "tel" was not correctly defined.
      > Deleted the spacing contained in the "tel" attribute fixed this.

#### CSS

 * No errors  were found when passed through the official [W3C Validator check](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
